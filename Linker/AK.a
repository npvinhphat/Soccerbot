;// Robot Control Algorithm
;// The idea is simple. There are two vectors: robot direction (vrb) and robot to target (vdes).
;// The vector vrb will rotate at an  angle of 'delta' which is equal to the  angle between 2 vectors.
;// So that two vectors will be on a same line and the robot can reach its destination.
;// However, in order to achieve robot's arrival with desired orientation, a new vector (vgoal), which
;// shows the desired orientation, is introduced and added to vrb before the rotation.
